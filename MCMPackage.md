# Multi-Chip Module

A multi-chip module (MCM) is an electronic package consisting of multiple integrated circuits (ICs) assembled into a single device. An MCM works as a single component and is capable of handling an entire function. The various components of a MCM are mounted on a substrate, and the bare dies of the substrate are connected to the surface via wire bonding, tape bonding or flip-chip bonding. The module can be encapsulated by a plastic molding and is mounted on the printed circuit board. MCMs offer better performance and can reduce the size of a device considerably.

As an integrated system, an MCM can improve the operation of a device and overcome size and weight constraints.

An MCM offers a packaging efficiency of more than 30%. Some of its advantages are as follows:

Improved performance as the length of the interconnection between dies is reduced
Lower power supply inductance
Lower capacitance loading
Less crosstalk
Lower off-chip driver power
Reduced size
Reduced time to market
Low-cost silicon sweep
Improved reliability
Increased flexibility as it helps in the integration of different semiconductor technologies
Simplified design and reduced complexity related to the packaging of several components into a single device.
MCMs can be manufactured using substrate technology, die attach and bonding technology, and encapsulation technology.

MCMs are classified based on the technology used to create the substrate. The different types of MCM are as follows:

MCM-L: Laminated MCM
MCM-D: Deposited MCM
MCM-C: Ceramic substrate MCM
