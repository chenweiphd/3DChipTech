EMIB

The concept is similar to that of a 2.5D package, but it differs in that there is no TSV. As a result, EMIB technology has the benefits of standard package yield, no additional process, and simple design.

 Compared to the traditional 2.5 packages, EMIB technology has the advantages of normal package yield, no additional process, and simple design because there is no TSV.

EMIB-of-Intel

Compared with the silicon interposer, EMIB silicon area is smaller and more flexible. EMIB packaging technology can package CPU, IO, GPU, and even FPGA, AI, and other chips together as needed. And it can package chips of 10nm, 14nm, 22nm, and other different processes together into a single chip to adapt to the needs of the flexible business.

Through the EMIB approach, the KBL-G platform integrates Intel Core processors with AMD Radeon RX Vega M GPUs, providing both the powerful computing capabilities of Intel processors and the outstanding graphics capabilities of AMD GPUs. This chip makes history and brings the product experience to a new level.

## 2 CoWoS of TSMC
CoWoS technology from TSMC is also a 2.5D packaging technology. There are three kinds of intermediate layers: CoWoS S uses Si substrate as the intermediate layer, CoWoS R uses RDL as the intermediate layer, and CoWoS L uses Chiplet and RDL as the intermediate layer.CoWoS and InFO are both from TSMC, CoWoS has Silicon Interposer and InFO does not.

The TSMC InFO (2D) and CoWoS (2.5D) differ in that CoWoS is aimed at the high-end market and has a greater number of wires and a larger package size. InFO for the cost-effective market, the package size is small, as is the number of connections.

The first-generation CoWoS is primarily employed in large FPGAs. CoWoS-1’s middle layer chip area is approximately 800 mm2, which is very close to the mask limit. Through mask splicing, the second-generation CoWoS significantly expands the size of the intermediate layer. TSMC initially met the 1200mm2 requirement but has since increased the intermediate layer size to 1700mm2. CoWoS-XL2 is the name given to these large packages.

CoWoS

CoWoS is the mainstream packaging technology that offers the highest interconnection density and largest package size with reasonable costs. As almost all HBM systems are currently packaged on CoWoS, and all advanced AI accelerators use HBM, the corollary is that virtually all leading-edge data center GPUs are packaged on CoWoS by TSMC. 


TSMC recently announced that the number of transistors in the fifth generation of CoWoS-S will be increased by 20 times, as will the area of the intermediate layer. In addition, the fifth generation package technology will include eight 128GB HBM2e RAM modules and two large SoC cores.

There are a few variants of CoWoS but the original CoWoS-S remains the only configuration in high volume production. This is the classic configuration as described above: logic die + HBM die are connected via a silicon-based interposer with TSVs. The interposer then sits on an organic package substrate.

CoWoS-R uses on organic substrate with redistribution layers (RDLs) instead of a silicon interposer. This is a lower cost variant that sacrifices I/O density due to using an organic RDL instead of a silicon-based interposer. As we have detailed, AMD’s MI300 was originally designed on CoWoS-R but we believe due to warpage and thermal stability concerns AMD has to instead use CoWoS-S.

CoWoS-L is expected to ramp later this year and utilises an RDL interposer but contains an active and/or passive silicon bridge used for die-to-die interconnect that is embedded inside the interposer. This is TSMC’s equivalent to Intel’s EMIB packaging technology. This will allow for larger package sizes as silicon interposers are getting harder to scale.

XDFOI-of-JCET
It performs better, is more reliable, and is less expensive than 2.5D TSV packaging technology. The system can implement a multi-layer wiring layer with a line distance or online width of up to 2um. Additionally, the package size is enormous and the extremely tiny pitch convex block interconnection technique is used. This allows for the integration of numerous chips, high bandwidth memory, and passive devices.

I-Cube-of-Sumsung
The I, X, R, and H-Cube advanced packages from Samsung are just a few examples. The I-Cube from Samsung also comes in 2.5D.
